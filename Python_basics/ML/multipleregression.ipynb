    " Multiple Linear Regression is an `extension of Simple Linear regression as it takes more than one predictor variable to predict the response variable`. It is an important regression algorithm that models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and more than one independent variable. It uses two or more independent variables to predict a dependent variable by fitting a best linear relationship."
